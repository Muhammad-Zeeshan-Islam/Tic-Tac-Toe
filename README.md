Tic-Tac-Toe:
•	Utilized my knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to develop a Tic Tac Toe game in C++ using Dev C++, where the user has to complete a pair of 3 rows, columns, or diagonals of the same sign to win the game. 
•	The Project featured 2 types of modes, one is Player vs Player and the other is Player vs CPU. The user has to choose any mode & can play it with the scoring system. It also has the feature of saving and loading a game. 
•	The project used Data Structures like Arrays and stacks, fstream for saving and loading the game, and a minimax algorithm for CPU mode.
