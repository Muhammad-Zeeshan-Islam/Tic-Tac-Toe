# Tic-Tac-Toe
•	Utilized my knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to develop a Tic Tac Toe game in C++ using Dev C++ where the user has to complete a pair of 3 rows, columns or diagonal of same sign to win the game. •	The Project featured 2 types of mode, one is Player vs Player and the other is player vs CPU. The user has to choose any mode & can play it with scoring system. It also has the feature of save and load game. •	The project used Data Structures like Arrays and Stack, fstream for save and load game, and minimax algorithm for CPU mode.
